### Scalariver with spray-can 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ferrlin/scalariver.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ferrlin/scalariver)

This is a fork of scalariver found here: https://github.com/ornicar/scalariver.

The only difference is that I use spray-can as the http server compared to tiscaf.

The demo can be found at http://scalariver.herokuapp.com
